The purpose of this app is to provide wine pairing that suit your drinking needs/ preferences. 
You should open the app and navigate to the survey page where you will complete the survey questions and be presented with an output according to your answers.
The output currently provides a list of wines that suit your preferences and their qualities, as well as a plot that shows the alcohol and sugar content as well as the quality score (>5), for
each output. The future hope of this app is to combine another wine dataset that includes wine names and qualities, so users can get the exact name of the recommended wine pairings and not have to base them
off the features when shopping.
